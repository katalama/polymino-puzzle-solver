# polymino-puzzle-solver
While participating Saint TeamLead Conference at 2023 y I spent about one hour to solve polymino puzzle at the "PVS Studio" stand.
After that I took a photo of pieces, returned to my hotel room abd spent 3 hours to create this solver.
Just for fun and with no optimisations.

I hope, I will have enough time to optimize it and rewrite in OOP style, but...
